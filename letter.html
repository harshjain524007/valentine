Dear Tara,

Happy Valentine’s Day Cutie Pie❤️🤗😘

I'm missing you so much today. It just doesn't feel the same without you by my side. I know 
you're super mad at me because for the second time in a row I'm away from you for Valentine's 
day. However, don't worry my sweetheart; I'll come back with a bang. Your actual gifts and 
date are pending, so stay tuned for that.

It also reminds me it's been a while since I've written you a note. I was looking forward 
to handing it in person to you but due to our circumstances and family commitments it will 
have to be online. One of the benefits to sharing this online, though, is that I can use emojis!

Today (and everyday), I just want to tell you how much I love you. I love you because you’re 
the prettiest girl I know. I love you because you’re the most caring person I know. I love you 
because you’re the best at what you do. I love you because you have the best values and 
principles. I love you because you’ll be the best wife and mother. I love you for everything 
you are.

You have no idea how much I appreciate you always being my biggest support and pillar through 
my highs and lows. Even when I’m working those long hours and literally killing myself, it 
gives me a lot of comfort knowing you are there to listen to me (and all my complaints 😂). 
Having that stability definitely makes me sleep a lot better at night. You don’t realize how 
much those small cheers, those little texts throughout the day, and motivational talks help 
me see the light at the end of the tunnel. 

Long distance is never easy, but seeing how we are handling and weathering it gives me a lot 
of confidence for the long term. I hope it stays that way. We both have made mutual efforts 
to communicate, to be there for each other, and see each other in person. We’re in this 
together and no one can change that, not even us. 

Keep smiling, keep loving, and keep calling me your boyfriend. Saying you’re my girlfriend 
even to this day makes my eyes get big. I can’t wait to celebrate our love once I’m back, 
and I’ll try to make it up to you in whatever way I can. Enjoy your day! I know it’s tough, 
but enjoy it for me. With this, Happy Valentine’s day again baby 🥰. I love you to the moon 
and back. Couldn’t ask for a better girlfriend and future…

With all my love,
Harsh
